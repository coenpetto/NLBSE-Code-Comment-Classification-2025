        "1. The pipeline begins by loading the dataset using ```load_dataset```. It is then organized per programming language, with each containing its own training and testing splits. Labels are then defined to represent different types of code comments and help guide the model in multilabel classification.\n",
        "2. Each training set is then further split into training and validation sets (80/20) to help monitor performance while training.\n",
        "3. The training set is then oversampled to increase representation of minority classes and each oversampled sample goes through synonym replacement to increase diversity further.\n",
        "4. For each sample, the class and comment sentence are concatenated together and fed into the ```prajjwal1/bert-tiny``` tokenizer to convert English words to numerical representations of them by applying padding and truncating to a fixed length of 128 tokens.\n",
        "5. The data is then converted from its tokenized output to tensors wpecifying the ```input_ids```, ```attention_mask```, and ```labels```.\n",
        "6. Class weights are then calculated inversely proportional to class frequencies, normalized, and used during the custom focal loss function to emphasize minority classed when training.\n",
        "7. The model is then defined and trained on the data from the pre-trained ```prajjwal1/bert-tiny``` model with our custom loss function and tuned configuration via the ```Trainer```.\n",
        "8. After training, the unaugmented validation set is used to fine-tune optimal thresholds per label to maximize the F1 score. These thresholds are used during inference to convert probabilities to binary predicions of labels.\n",
        "9. When evaluating on the test set, the trained model and tokenizer is loaded for each language and the test set is tokenized in the same manner as the training/validation sets. Inference is then ran 10 times for each language while measuring the FLOPS and runtime of the inference function.\n",
        "10. After obtaining a tensor of predections from inference, the precision, recall, and F1 score for each category are aggregated into a dataframe.\n",
        "11. Using the submission score formula, the average GFLOPS, average runtime, and calculated metrics are used to generate the final submission score."
